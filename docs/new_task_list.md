## 8. NEW TASKS - Resource Optimization & UI Improvements

### 8.1 Duplicate Image Removal System (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: The system currently downloads and processes the same images multiple times when they appear on different pages of the same website, wasting storage space, bandwidth, and processing time.

**Solution Required**: Implement a deduplication system that:
- Identifies duplicate images across pages based on URL
- Prevents re-downloading and re-processing of duplicate images
- Maintains a registry of processed images
- Provides statistics on duplicates removed and resources saved

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/crawler_module.py` - Add deduplication logic during image collection
- `src/blur_detector.py` - Integrate with image registry for duplicate detection
- Database schema - Add image_registry table for tracking processed images

**Expected Benefits**:
- Reduced storage usage (eliminate duplicate image files)
- Faster processing (fewer images to analyze)
- Better resource utilization
- Cost savings on storage and bandwidth

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive duplicate image removal system
**Completion Date**: August 20, 2025
**Implementation Details**:
- Added deduplication logic in crawler module using URL-based tracking
- Enhanced blur detection summary with duplicate statistics
- Comprehensive logging for duplicate detection and resource savings
- Test script validates functionality with 50% storage savings demonstrated
- Ready for production use with automatic duplicate prevention

### 8.2 Performance Results UI Enhancement ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: Performance results page only shows desktop results in some cases, missing the intended two-column layout (Mobile | Desktop)

**Current Issue**:
- Template expects both `mobile` and `desktop` data for each page
- Performance checker collects data for both devices but template may not be receiving it correctly
- Some pages only show one device type instead of the intended side-by-side comparison

**Solution Required**:
- Investigate why mobile/desktop data isn't being passed correctly to template
- Ensure performance checker always returns both device types
- Fix template logic to properly display both columns
- Verify data flow from performance checker → app.py → template

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/performance_checker.py` - Ensure both device types are always returned
- `src/app.py` - Fix data grouping logic for mobile/desktop results
- `templates/performance_results.html` - Verify template logic

**Expected Result**:
- Each page shows two columns: Mobile Performance | Desktop Performance
- Both device types display their respective metrics side by side
- Consistent layout across all performance results

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fixed data structure mapping and grouping logic
**Completion Date**: August 21, 2025
**Implementation Details**:
- Fixed data grouping logic in `app.py` to properly structure mobile/desktop data
- Added field mapping to ensure template receives expected field names (fcp_display, fcp_score, etc.)
- Added performance grade calculation (A, B, C) for better user experience
- Verified data structure flows correctly from database → app.py → template
- Template now receives properly formatted data for two-column layout
- Ready for testing with real performance data

## 9. Critical Scheduler Issues (URGENT)

### 9.1 Duplicate Scheduler Execution (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Scheduler is running twice instead of once, causing duplicate checks
- **Evidence**: 
  - `01:27:39` - First scheduler instance started
  - `01:27:45` - Second scheduler instance started (6 seconds later)
  - Both instances are executing the same monitoring tasks
- **Root Cause**: Multiple scheduler threads being created during app startup
- **Impact**: Double resource usage, duplicate database entries, incorrect timing
- **Solution**: Implement singleton pattern for scheduler, ensure only one instance runs
- **Files to Fix**: `src/scheduler_integration.py`, `src/app.py`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - This is causing resource waste and duplicate processing

### 9.2 Blur Detection Syntax Error (HIGH)
- **Problem**: `blur_detector.py` line 262 has syntax error preventing blur detection
- **Error**: `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block`
- **Impact**: Blur detection fails, but monitoring continues with reduced functionality
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete try-except block in blur_detector.py
- **Solution**: Fix the syntax error in the try-except block at line 262
- **Files to Fix**: `src/blur_detector.py`
- **Priority**: HIGH - This is blocking blur detection functionality

### 9.3 Scheduler Timing Bug (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: Scheduler runs every ~18 minutes instead of 1 hour as configured
- **Expected**: 1 hour (60 minutes) intervals
- **Actual**: ~18 minute intervals between runs
- **Root Cause**: Scheduler timing calculation error or multiple instances interfering
- **Solution**: Fix timing logic and ensure single scheduler instance
- **Files to Fix**: `src/scheduler.py`, `src/scheduler_integration.py`
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - This affects monitoring frequency but doesn't break functionality

## 10. Minor TODO Items (Non-Blocking)

### 10.1 Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Implement Age-based Image Cleanup** (LOW PRIORITY)
  - **Location**: `src/blur_detector.py` line 849
  - **Description**: Add logic to automatically clean up old blur detection images based on age
  - **Status**: Not blocking core functionality

- [ ] **Site-specific Threshold Overrides** (LOW PRIORITY)
  - **Location**: `src/scheduler.py` line 125
  - **Description**: Allow individual websites to override general performance thresholds
  - **Status**: Not blocking core functionality

## Priority Legend

- **HIGH**: Critical issues affecting core functionality, user experience, or system performance
