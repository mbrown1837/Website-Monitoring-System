**Project: Automated Website Monitoring System**

**1. Overview**
The Automated Website Monitoring System is designed to monitor a predefined list of websites,
detect changes, and report any discrepancies from their original versions. The system will use a
combination of web content retrieval, snapshotting, and comparison techniques to identify both
visual and non-visual differences.
**2. Goals**
The primary goals of this system are to:
    ● Provide automated and regular monitoring of websites.
    ● Identify a wide range of changes, including content, layout, and technical elements.
    ● Deliver timely alerts about detected changes.
    ● Maintain a history of website versions for auditing and analysis.
**3. Features**
The system must provide the following features:
    ● **Website List Management:** The ability to manage a configurable list of websites to be
       monitored.
    ● **Scheduled Monitoring:** Automated checks of the websites at predefined intervals.
    ● **Content Change Detection:** Detection of modifications, additions, or removals of text
       content.
    ● **Layout Change Detection:** Identification of changes in the HTML structure and visual
       layout of web pages.
    ● **Technical Element Change Detection:** Monitoring and detection of changes to meta
       tags, SEO parameters, and embedded links.
    ● **Media Change Detection:** Detection of changes to images or other media files on the
       websites.
    ● **Performance Monitoring (Optional):** Tracking and reporting on page load performance.
    ● **Intelligent Content Comparison:** The ability to detect semantic content changes, rather
       than just simple text differences.
    ● **Alerting:** Notification of detected changes through email or a dashboard interface.
    ● **Version History:** Storage and management of website snapshots to track changes over
       time.
    ● **Visual Difference Highlighting:** Presentation of visual changes in a clear and intuitive
       manner (e.g., side-by-side comparison or overlay).
    ● **Reporting:** Generation of reports in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, PDF).
**4. System Architecture**
The system should be designed with the following high-level architecture:
    ● **Website URL List:** A component to store and manage the list of websites to be
       monitored.
    ● **Scheduler/Runner:** A component to schedule and execute the monitoring process.
    ● **Web Content Retriever:** A component to retrieve the content of the web pages.
    ● **Snapshot Tool:** A component to capture snapshots of the web pages (both content and
       visual representation).
    ● **Content Comparator:** A component to compare the current web page content and
       snapshots with stored versions.
    ● **Change Detector:** A component to analyze the comparison results and determine if
       significant changes have occurred.
    ● **Report Generator:** A component to generate reports summarizing the detected changes.
    ● **Notification/Display:** A component to provide notifications (e.g., email) and/or display the

monitoring results.

**5. Functional Requirements**
    ● **Website List Management:**
       ○ The system must allow users to add, remove, and modify the list of websites to be
          monitored.
       ○ The system must be able to handle a configurable number of websites.
    ● **Scheduled Monitoring:**
       ○ The system must allow for flexible scheduling of monitoring checks (e.g., hourly,
          daily, weekly).
       ○ The scheduling mechanism must be reliable and ensure that checks are performed
          as scheduled.
    ● **Content Retrieval:**
       ○ The system must be able to retrieve the HTML content of web pages.
       ○ The system should be able to handle various web page structures and encodings.
    ● **Snapshotting:**
       ○ The system must be able to create snapshots of web pages, including both the
          HTML content and visual representation (e.g., screenshots).
       ○ The snapshotting process should be consistent and reproducible.
    ● **Comparison:**
       ○ The system must be able to compare current web page content and snapshots with
          stored versions.
       ○ The comparison process must be able to detect different types of changes (e.g.,
          text changes, layout changes, image changes).
       ○ The comparison process should be efficient and scalable.
    ● **Change Detection:**
       ○ The system must be able to analyze the comparison results and determine if
          changes are significant enough to warrant an alert.
       ○ The system should allow for configurable thresholds or rules to define "significant
          changes."
    ● **Reporting:**
       ○ The system must be able to generate reports summarizing the detected changes.
       ○ The reports should include details about the changed elements, the time of the
          change, and links to previous and current versions (if applicable).
       ○ The system should support multiple report formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, PDF).
    ● **Notification/Display:**
       ○ The system must be able to notify users of detected changes through email or other
          channels.
       ○ The system may include a dashboard to display monitoring results and provide a
          user interface for managing the system.
**6. Non-Functional Requirements**
    ● **Reliability:** The system must be reliable and provide accurate monitoring results.
    ● **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of websites and
       increasing monitoring frequency.
    ● **Performance:** The system should perform monitoring checks efficiently and minimize the
       impact on website performance.
    ● **Maintainability:** The system should be designed to be easily maintained and updated.
    ● **Security:** The system should be secure and protect sensitive data.
