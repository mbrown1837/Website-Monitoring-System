    - [x] Implement checks for changes in embedded links (anchor tags `href` attributes).
- [x] **Task 6.4: Media Change Detection**
    - [x] For images: Compare image hashes or use image diffing libraries. (Initial check for src changes done)
    - [x] For other media: Basic checks like file size or URL changes. (Covered by image src check for now)
- [ ] **Task 6.5: Intelligent Content Comparison (Semantic - Advanced)**

- [x] **Task 6.6: Visual Comparison (Screenshots)**
    - [x] Implement comparison of current screenshots with stored versions (e.g., pixel-by-pixel, or using image comparison libraries like Pillow or OpenCV).
- [x] **Task 6.7: Change Significance & Thresholds**
    - [x] Develop a system to define and configure thresholds for what constitutes a "significant change." (Initial config in place, comparators provide metrics)
    - [x] Allow users to customize sensitivity for different types of changes or websites. (Via config)

## Phase 7: Version History

- [x] **Task 7.1: Storing Website Versions**
    - [x] Implement the storage and management of website snapshots (HTML, screenshots, extracted data) to track changes over time. (Snapshots stored by timestamp, history manager logs metadata)
    - [x] Associate versions with timestamps and change summaries. (History manager logs this)

## Phase 8: Alerting & Notification
