Alright, here's a detailed breakdown of the Python-based website monitoring system that you can share with your development team:

**Project: Automated Website Monitoring System**

**1.  Overview**

[cite_start]The Automated Website Monitoring System is designed to monitor a list of predefined websites, detect changes, and report any discrepancies from their original versions[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]The system will use a combination of web scraping, snapshotting, and comparison techniques to identify both visual and non-visual differences[cite: 2].

**2.  Features**

* Monitors a specified list of websites.
* Detects changes in:
    * [cite_start]Text (content modifications, additions, removals) [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]HTML structure and layout [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]Meta tags and SEO parameters [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]Embedded links [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]Images or media file changes [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]Page load performance (optional) [cite: 3]
* [cite_start]Performs checks at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily or hourly)[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]Provides alerts via email[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]Stores version history of website snapshots[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]Generates reports in JSON, CSV, or PDF format[cite: 5].

**3.  System Architecture**

[cite_start]The system architecture consists of the following components (as shown in the attached document)[cite: 5, 6]:

* **Website URL List:** A configurable list of URLs to be monitored.
* [cite_start]**Scheduler/Runner:** A component that triggers the monitoring process at scheduled intervals (e.g., using `cron` or a Python scheduler)[cite: 5].
* **Web Scraper:** Retrieves the HTML content of the web pages and extracts relevant information.
* **Screenshot Tool:** Captures screenshots of the web pages.
* **Content Comparator:** Compares the current web page content and screenshots with the stored versions.
* **Change Detector:** Analyzes the comparison results and determines if any significant changes have occurred.
* **Report Generator:** Creates reports summarizing the detected changes.
* [cite_start]**Email/Dashboard:** Sends email alerts and/or displays the monitoring results in a dashboard[cite: 6].

**4.  Technology Stack**

* [cite_start]**Backend Scripting:** Python [cite: 7]
* [cite_start]**Web Scraping:** `BeautifulSoup`, `requests` [cite: 7]
* **Screenshotting:** `Selenium` or `pyppeteer`
* **Content Comparison:** `diff-match-patch`, `Pillow` (PIL) or `OpenCV`
* **Task Scheduling:** `schedule` or `APScheduler`
* **Reporting:** Python's built-in `csv`, `json` libraries, or `reportlab` (for PDF)
* **Email:** `smtplib` (Python's built-in email library)
* **Storage:** `SQLite` (for lightweight storage) or file system (for screenshots)

**5.  Detailed Component Description**

* **5.1 Website URL List**

    * This is a simple configuration file (e.g., a text file or a Python list) that contains the URLs of the websites to be monitored.
    * It should be easy to add, remove, or modify the URLs in this list.

* **5.2 Scheduler/Runner**

    * This component is responsible for executing the monitoring script at predefined intervals.
    * Python libraries like `schedule` or `APScheduler` can be used to implement this functionality.
    * The scheduler should be configurable to allow for different monitoring frequencies (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).

* **5.3 Web Scraper**

    * This component retrieves the HTML content of the web pages.
    * `requests` library is used to send HTTP requests to the URLs.
    * `BeautifulSoup` is used to parse the HTML content, making it easy to extract specific elements (e.g., text, links, images).

* **5.4 Screenshot Tool**

    * This component captures screenshots of the web pages.
    * `Selenium` or `pyppeteer` can be used to control a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and take screenshots.
    * It's important to use a consistent browser configuration (e.g., window size, resolution) to ensure consistent screenshots.

* **5.5 Content Comparator**

    * This component compares the current web page content and screenshots with the stored versions.
    * `diff-match-patch` is used to compare text and HTML content efficiently, highlighting the differences.
    * `Pillow` (PIL) or `OpenCV` is used to compare screenshots.
        * `Pillow` can be used for basic pixel-by-pixel comparison.
        * `OpenCV` provides more advanced image comparison techniques, such as Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), which often aligns better with human perception.

* **5.6 Change Detector**

    * This component analyzes the output of the Content Comparator and determines if any significant changes have occurred.
    * It involves setting thresholds for text/HTML differences (e.g., percentage of changed text) and image differences (e.g., SSIM value or percentage of different pixels).
    * The thresholds should be configurable to allow for flexibility in defining what constitutes a "significant change."

* **5.7 Report Generator**

    * This component generates reports summarizing the detected changes.
    * Python's built-in `csv` and `json` libraries can be used to create reports in these formats.
    * `reportlab` library can be used to generate PDF reports, if needed.
    * The reports should include details about the changed elements, the time of the change, and links to the old and new versions (if applicable).

* **5.8 Email/Dashboard**

    * This component provides notifications about the detected changes.
    * `smtplib` is used to send email alerts.
    * Optionally, a simple web dashboard can be built using Flask or FastAPI to display the monitoring results in a user-friendly interface.

**6.  Implementation Details**

* **Baseline Establishment:**
    * For visual comparison, it's crucial to establish a baseline screenshot for each page.
    * This baseline should be captured when the page's layout is known to be correct.
* **Image Comparison Considerations:**
    * Experiment with different image comparison metrics (e.g., pixel difference, SSIM) and thresholds to find the optimal settings for detecting relevant layout changes while minimizing false positives.
    * Consider techniques for handling dynamic content (e.g., masking or ignoring specific regions of the screenshots).
* **Error Handling:**
    * Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle website downtime, network issues, and other potential problems.
    * Log errors and exceptions to facilitate debugging.
* **Scalability:**
    * Design the system with scalability in mind, especially if the number of websites to be monitored is expected to grow.
    * Consider using asynchronous tasks or message queues (e.g., Celery) to distribute the workload.
