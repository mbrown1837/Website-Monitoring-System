You are a meticulous and proactive Senior Software Engineer. Based on the conclusive comparative analysis, `gflare-tk` has been selected as the optimal web crawler for the Automated Website Monitoring System due to its superior error handling, comprehensive detection capabilities, and compatibility. Your immediate task is to systematically remove all traces of the previous `YiraBot-Crawler` integration and seamlessly integrate `gflare-tk` to implement the broken links and missing meta tags detection features.

**Phase 1: Complete Removal of YiraBot-Crawler**

1.  **Identify and Delete:** Meticulously locate and remove all code, configuration entries, file paths, and any dependencies specifically related to `YiraBot-Crawler` from the entire codebase. This includes:
    * Any import statements, function calls, or class instances related to YiraBot.
    * Any configuration parameters that were specific to YiraBot's operation.
    * Any temporary or cached files generated by YiraBot.
    * Any database entries or schema modifications that were exclusively for YiraBot's data.
2.  **Clean-up Dependencies:** Ensure `YiraBot-Crawler` and its specific dependencies (e.g., `Playwright` if it was installed solely for YiraBot) are no longer listed or imported, aiming for a lean and focused dependency tree.

**Phase 2: Greenflare (`gflare-tk`) Integration and Core Feature Implementation**

1.  **Greenflare Integration:**
    * **Installation:** Ensure `gflare-tk` and its necessary dependencies (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `lxml` if not already present) are correctly integrated into the project's dependency management system.
    * **Core Integration:** Integrate `gflare-tk` into the `Web Content Retriever` or create a new dedicated `Crawler` module. Leverage Greenflare's built-in async architecture, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and rate limiting to address previous connection issues and ensure robust crawling.
    * **Configuration:** Implement clear configuration options for Greenflare, including crawl depth, rate limits, and timeout settings.

2.  **Broken Links Detection:**
    * **Crawling Logic:** Configure Greenflare to recursively crawl internal and external links within a specified depth for each monitored website.
    * **Status Code Analysis:** Utilize Greenflare's capabilities to detect and classify HTTP status codes, specifically flagging:
        * `4xx` client error codes (especially `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`, `410 Gone`).
        * `5xx` server error codes.
        * Network-level errors (e.g., DNS failures, connection timeouts, unreachable hosts).
    * **Referring Page Tracking:** Ensure that for every detected broken link, the URL of the *referring page* where the link was found is captured and stored.
    * **Data Model Update:** Update the SQLite database schema to store details about broken links, including `broken_url`, `referring_page_url`, `status_code/error_type`, and `timestamp`.

3.  **Missing Meta Tags Detection:**
    * **HTML Parsing:** For every HTML page successfully retrieved by Greenflare, use its `XPath`/`CSS` selectors and `ETK metadata parser` to extract:
        * The content of the `<title>` tag.
        * The content of the `<meta name="description" ...>` tag.
        * The `alt` attribute for all `<img>` tags.
    * **Comprehensive Flagging:** Accurately flag instances where:
        * The `<title>` tag is missing or empty (`<title></title>`).
        * The `<meta name="description">` tag is missing or empty (`<meta name="description" content="">`).
        * An `<img>` tag has a missing or empty `alt` attribute.
    * **Contextual Reporting:** For missing `alt` text, ensure the report includes the URL of the image itself and the URL of the page where the image was found.
    * **Data Model Update:** Update the SQLite database schema to store details about missing meta tags, including `page_url`, `missing_element_type` (e.g., 'title', 'meta_description', 'img_alt'), and `related_url` (for image `src` if `alt` is missing).

**Phase 3: Backend API, Reporting, and History Integration**

1.  **API Endpoints:**
    * **New API Endpoints:** Create dedicated API endpoints to expose the newly collected broken links and missing meta tag data.
        * `GET /api/websites/{website_id}/broken_links`: Retrieve a list of broken links for a specific website.
        * `GET /api/websites/{website_id}/missing_meta_tags`: Retrieve a list of missing meta tags for a specific website.
        * Ensure these endpoints support filtering (e.g., by date range) and pagination for large datasets.
    * **Existing API Updates:** Modify existing API endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/websites/{website_id}/history`) to optionally include summaries or direct links to the new broken link/meta tag reports within the historical context.

2.  **Content Comparator & Change Detector Update:**
    * Integrate the output from Greenflare's broken link and meta tag detection into the `Content Comparator & Change Detector`.
    * Define thresholds for "significant changes" related to these new features (e.g., a new broken link appearing, a previously present title tag now missing).
    * Trigger `Alerting System` notifications when significant changes in broken links or meta tags are detected.

3.  **Reporting Module Enhancement:**
    * Update the `Reporting Module` to generate comprehensive reports that include dedicated sections for:
        * **Broken Links:** List the broken URL, referring page URL, and HTTP status code/error for each.
        * **Missing Meta Tags:** List the page URL, the type of missing element (`title`, `meta description`, `alt text`), and the image URL if applicable.
    * Ensure these new sections are available in both JSON and CSV report formats.

4.  **Version History Management:**
    * Ensure the `Version History Management System` stores snapshots that include the status of broken links and missing meta tags at the time of the crawl, allowing for historical comparisons of these issues.

**Phase 4: User Interface (UI) Enhancement**

* **Dashboard Integration:** Update the main dashboard to provide summary statistics for broken links and missing meta tags across all monitored websites (e.g., "Total Broken Links," "Websites with Missing Titles").
* **Dedicated UI Sections:**
    * Create dedicated UI sections or expand existing website detail views to display the granular broken link and missing meta tag data retrieved from the new API endpoints.
    * **Broken Links Section:** Present broken links in a clear, sortable, and filterable table format, showing the broken URL, referring page, and status/error.
    * **Missing Meta Tags Section:** Display missing meta tags in a table or list, indicating the page URL, the specific missing tag (title, meta description), or image URL for missing alt text.
* **UI/UX Polish:** Leverage the provided sample HTML files (dashboard, broken link section, meta title section) as strong inspiration to ensure the new UI elements are visually consistent, responsive, and intuitive, integrating seamlessly with the existing design language.

**Quality Assurance:**

* **Thorough Testing:** Conduct comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to verify that:
    * YiraBot-Crawler has been completely removed.
    * Greenflare is correctly integrated and reliably performs crawls.
    * Broken links are accurately detected and reported with referring pages.
    * Missing/empty title tags, meta descriptions, and image `alt` attributes are correctly identified.
    * All new data is persistently stored in SQLite.
    * New API endpoints function correctly and provide accurate data.
    * Frontend UI correctly fetches and displays the new data, and routing works seamlessly.
    * Alerts are triggered for significant changes in these new categories.
    * Reports include the new data in the specified formats.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Test the performance of the Greenflare integration to ensure it operates efficiently without excessive resource consumption on the backend or undue load on monitored websites.
